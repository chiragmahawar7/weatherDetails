Hackerrank Angular Certificate Challenge

## Functionality Requirements
- An array of objects is passed as a prop to the component, where each object is a weather record for a single city. The object has 4 properties:
    1. name: The name of the city. [STRING]
    2. temperature: The temperature in the city. [STRING]
    3. wind: The wind in the city. [STRING]
    4. humidity: The humidity in the cit.y [STRING]

- There is an input field for the city name where the user can type the name of a city to search the weather data for. (The city name is case-insensitive.)

- If data exists for the typed input, render the weather details
